    Welcom to Kandal
    <p>
      Kandal (Khmer: កណ្ដាល,'Middle') is a province of Cambodia located in the
      southeast portion of the country. It completely surrounds the Cambodian
      capital of Phnom Penh and borders the provinces of Kampong Speu and Takéo
      to the west, Kampong Chhnang and Kampong Cham to the north, Prey Veng to
      the east, and shares an international border with Vietnam (An Giang and
      Đồng Tháp) to the south. It is the second most populous province in
      Cambodia after the capital Phnom Penh. Its capital and largest city is Ta
      Khmau, which is approximately eight kilometres (5.0 mi) south of central
      Phnom Penh. Kandal is one of the wealthier provinces in the country.
