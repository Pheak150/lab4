    <p>
      Oddar Meanchey (Khmer: ឧត្តរមានជ័យ 'Victorious North') is a province of
      Cambodia in the remote northwest. It borders the provinces of Banteay
      Meanchey to the west, Siem Reap to the south and Preah Vihear to the east.
      Its long northern boundary demarcates part of Cambodia's international
      border with Thailand. The capital is Samraong. The province was created on
      27 April 1999, after being carved from the northern half of Siem Reap
      province and part of Banteay Meanchey. It existed as a province already
      from 1962 to 1970 under Norodom Sihanouk's Sangkum regime, but later
      became an administrative no-man's-land, with its status alternating
      between a province and a district under successive regimes.
