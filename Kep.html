    Welcome to Kaep
    <p>
      Kep (Khmer: ខេត្តកែប) is the smallest province (khaet) of Cambodia
      covering 336 km2 (130 sq mi), with a population of 41,798. It is one of
      the newest Cambodian provinces, together with Pailin, Sihanoukville and
      Tboung Khmum, created by Royal Decree on 22 December 2008, which separated
      Kep Municipality & Damnak Chang'aeur District from the Kampot province, as
      well as adjusting several provincial borders. It is both the smallest and
      least populous province of Cambodia. The provincial capital is Kep and the
      province contains the Kep National Park.
