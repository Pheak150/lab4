    Welcom to Battambang
    <p>
      Prey Veng (Khmer: ព្រៃវែង 'High Forest') is a province (khaet) of
      Cambodia. The capital is Prey Veng. With a population of 1.1 million
      people, it is the third most populous province. This densely populated
      agricultural region is located on the east bank of the Mekong. The name
      literally means "long forest" in khmer, but the last great forests have
      gradually disappeared there over 30-year to provide for agricultural land.
