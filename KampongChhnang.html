    Welcom to KampongChhnang
    <p>
      Kampong Chhnang (Khmer: កំពង់ឆ្នាំង; meaning 'Port of Pottery') is one of
      the central provinces (khaet) of Cambodia. Neighboring provinces are (from
      north clockwise) Kampong Thom, Kampong Cham, Kandal, Kampong Speu, and
      Pursat. The provincial capital is the city of Kampong Chhnang.<br />Kampong
      Chhnang province centuries ago was a coastal city on the route between
      China and India; due to sedimentation from the Mekong river, the coast
      line moved much farther to sea. When the Tonle Sap river changed its
      course, the city lost its main water source and thus was deserted, the
      population moving to a city called Kampong Tralach. A city gradually
      formed around it, bring new life to Kampong Chhnang. A museum presents the
      archaeological record of the city's history.
