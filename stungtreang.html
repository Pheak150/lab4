    <p>
      Stung Treng (Khmer: ស្ទឹងត្រែង,"River of Reeds") is a province of Cambodia
      in the northeast. It borders the provinces of Ratanakiri to the east,
      Mondulkiri and Kratié to the south and Kampong Thom and Preah Vihear to
      the west. Its northern boundary is Cambodia's international border with
      Laos. The Mekong River bisects the province. The province is mostly
      covered by forest, but logging and fishing put high pressure on the forest
      and fishery reserves.
