      Vihear to the north, Stung Treng to the northeast, Kratie to the east,
      Kampong Cham and Kampong Chhnang to the south, and the Tonle Sap to the

      people on the banks of the Stung Sen River. Kampong Thom is Cambodia's
      second largest province by area. There are a number of significant
      Angkorian sites in the area, including Prasat Sambor Prei Kuk and Prasat
