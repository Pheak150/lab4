    Welcom to Battambang
    <p>
      Battambang (Khmer: បាត់ដំបង, 'The Lost Stick') is a province of Cambodia
      in the far northwest of the country. Bordering provinces are Banteay
      Meanchey to the north, Pursat to the east and south, Siem Reap to the
      northeast, and Pailin to the west. The northern and southern extremes of
      the province's western boundaries form part of the international border
      with Thailand. In addition, Tonlé Sap forms part of the northeastern
      boundary between Siem Reap and Pursat. Its capital and largest city is
      Battambang. It is the fifth most populous province in Cambodia. In land
      area, Battambang is the fifth largest province of Cambodia. Battambang is
      one of the provinces included in the Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve.[2] The
      province's fertile rice fields have led to a mostly agricultural economy
      giving rise to the moniker "the rice bowl of Cambodia". The province
      features a range of cultures as well as natural resources. Seventy five
      percent of the area is jungles and mountains. The area has a tropical
      climate.
