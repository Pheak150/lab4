  <h1>Preah Sihanouk Province</h1>
  <body>
    Welcom to Preah Sihanouk
    <p>
      Preah Sihanouk (Khmer: ព្រះសីហនុ, 'Holy Sihanouk'), also Sihanoukville, is
      a province (khaet) in southwest Cambodia on the Gulf of Thailand. The
      provincial capital, also called Sihanoukville, is a deep water port city
      and a steadily growing and diversifying urban center on an elevated
      peninsula. First established as Kampong Som (Khmer: កំពង់សោម, lit. 'The
      Som Rattan Port'), the province was later renamed in honor of former King
      Norodom Sihanouk, who orchestrated the establishment of Sihanoukville city
      and the Sihanoukville municipality as this took place alongside the
      construction of the Sihanoukville Port, which commenced in June 1955. The
      only deep water port of Cambodia, it includes an oil terminal and a
      transport logistics facility.
